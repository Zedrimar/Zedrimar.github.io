                A NOTE TO THE INTERNET AT LARGE: This is a university project, and will be taken down soon after. I CLAIM NO RIGHTS TO ANY CONTENT USED ON THIS SITE! The images used in the carousel are all stock photos. You can find them anywhere. The rest is credited on the resources page.

                You have been selected to join the army of derp!
                Did you seriously think this was a real city? Nah, we don't do cities around here. Now then, to business! You must now take the oath shown below. No, you can't just skip it like the half a dozen other ads you wanted to put on here, dave. Anyway, this is absolutely mandatory for you to survive. Otherwise, you will become a foot rest in your next incarnation. Not just any foot rest though, one for only the most smelly and hairy of feet. After you have done that, feel free to browse the site. Maybe you will find something interesting that dave didn't find. Who's Dave? Oh, he's just the site editor that I totally didn't just make up.

            <div class="scrollbox">
                <center>
                    <p>
                        By coming here, you swear that you will follow this oath to the fullest. I (insert name here), vow to be part of the clan for all of eternity, serving the great allmighty sir derp the 40th, in his quest to make the world one. You also swear that you agree to everything in this totally legit and not ridiculous agreement which is totally correct in every way, shape and form. If you do not agree with this, well, too bad. You are recruited regardless. If you do not keep to this agreement, your next incarnation will be a foot rest. You will also then be reincarnated into a sock.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You could also, of course just ignore this, as it isn't that important. Well, what are you waiting for? Search the rest of the site why don't ya! Porch pirates buried more treasure somewhere! (They actually didn't, but you may find the resources page somewhat useful).
