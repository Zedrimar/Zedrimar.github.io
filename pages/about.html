                    Now, you may be wondering.... Is this for real? Is this the real project? Truth is, yes, yes it is. My whole goal with this was more or less to make something mildly interesting and a bit funny, rather than just a generic website. I could have just as easily made a blog, or some site showing off something, but I kinda wanted to stand out a bit with this one (in a good way of course). Hope you enjoy the ridiculous stuff I decided to pile on here, because there's quite a bit! Well, relatively speaking. Outside of the text stuff, I actually tried to put something useful for things like the videos. Everything else is more or less just a joke. I didn't quite get time to implement a JS game yet as of now, but maybe later I will be able to put one in. Either myself, or embedded somehow. If outside sources used, credits will be in resources.

                    This is not the end for my website shinanigans though, as I do plan to redesign this for my own personal use, sometime in the summer months, and then host it privately (rent a server or something).
